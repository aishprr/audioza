Audio Analyzer tool created as 15-112 Term Project 

This software allows the user to analyze and edit audio files in the .wav format.
Upto 8 files can be uploaded and accessed with the help of tabs at the top, and menu buttons
on the left side allow the user to edit in terms of cut, copy, paste, remove voice, remove noise
and play the files after any of these operations. The approximate sheet music can also be 
generated by the software for any mono file that is provided by the user.

The program can be run by first installing Python 2.7 - from  http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/
and then installing the modules.

The modules that are required to be installed to run the program (with python 2.7 already installed) are:
